## Data

The platform uses cryptocurrency data from the Yahoo Finance API, covering 30 coins over a 4-year period.

## Models

The platform employs several machine learning models:
- LSTM Neural Networks
- XGBoost
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

These models are used for price prediction and generating trading signals.

## Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is assessed using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- R-squared (R2) coefficient
